# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This project allows users to look at a five day forecast for the city of their choice using a third party API, OpenWeatherMap. This project also utilizes a CSS library, Bulma, to provide quick CSS work. This application allows the user to look at the current and upcoming five days of weather. The weather information that will display are the temperature (in Fahrenheit), wind speed (in miles per hour, denoted as MPH), and humidity (%). There will also be an icon that represents the corresponding weather conditions.

## Usage
* Please click on the following link of the deployed website, https://leeclaire156.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

* The application should appear as so on screens upon load if the user has never used the application:

* The application should appear as so on screens upon load if the user has previously used the application:
![Homepage if previously used](./Develop/Images/Weather-Homepage.png) 

* When the user looks up a city, a button with the city's name is created under the search input area and both the current weather along with its upcoming five day forecast will be displayed on the right side of the search area.
